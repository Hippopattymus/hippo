    <ol>
        <li>The hippopotamus is one of the most aggressive creatures in the world and is often regarded as one of the most dangerous animals in Africa. However, if threatened on land it will often run for water.</li>
        <li>The name Hippopotamus comes from the Ancient Greek 'river horse</li>
        <li>Hippos bask on the shoreline and secrete an oily red substance, which gave rise to the myth that they sweat blood.</li>
        <li>They are only territorial while in the water.</li>
        <li>Despite its stocky shape and short legs, it can easily outrun most humans. Hippos have been clocked at 30 km/h over short distances.</li>
    </ol>
